House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned moved to King's landing; he was totally murdered; the entire land
fell into disarray and a period of chaos for 200 years. Sucks.

Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to
being, and let me assure you he will DEFINITELY NOT DIE!

But alas! Joffrey had an identical twin also named Joffrey.  He was even more evil.  Just a total loser.

Yes he was Zach, yes he was!

Demo line.
